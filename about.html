<h3>Panchat v1.0A</h3>
<b>The awesome PHP Chat Script, what dont use any MySQL DBs! \(:D)/</b>
<ul>What includes this version?
<li>Chat :3</li>
<li>Moderation panel for ban IPs, you can ban them and they cannot send messages, or dont use the "Clear chat" function</li>
<li>Settings: Auto-Load5 - You can enable it, and the main page will reload every 5 seconds.</li>
<li>Delete/Clear chat - You can delete globally the chat</li>
<li>You can change your nick in any time!</li>
<li>For prevent some strange things, the IP its showed globally by default.</li>
<li>By default, all messages are stored in an only file "data.txt", this can be changed modifying "config_auth.php"</li>
</ul>
<ul>Issues: 
<li>If do you send a message with this symbol -> ' the script will crash, this have solution, only replace index.php by delete.php in the url bar. If you are banned and cannot use a function, tell a friend. i will fix this later, but isnt easy, so, uhm, probably i dont fix this never...</li>
</ul>
<ul>To do:
<li>Lock the "Delete chat" function to only allowed IPs</li>
<li>Ban nicks</li>
<li>Ban words</li>
<b>Probably the first function may be hard to code it. But i accept the challenge :3</b>
<b>Fieldset is love, fieldset is live <3</b>
