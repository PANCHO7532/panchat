# Panchat
## The awesome PHP Chat Script, what dont use any MySQL DBs! \(:D)/
Thats it, in this version (1.5.7b) we prepared a few things!

- Chat

- Moderation panel for ban IPs, you can ban them and they cannot send messages, or dont use the "Clear chat" function, also you can ban nicknames

- You can lock the delete chat function only for allowed IPs or make the chat deletable for everyone

- Settings: Auto-Load5 - You can enable it, and the main page will reload every 5 seconds or the time configured in config_auth.php.

- Delete/Clear chat - You can delete globally the chat

- You can change your nick in any time!

- Enable/disable Embedded HTML Code - CHECK IT OUT IN config_auth.php!

- For prevent some strange things, the IP its showed globally by default.

- By default, all messages are stored in an only file "data.txt", this can be changed modifying "config_auth.php"

## Issues

- Nothing for the moment

## To do:

- Ban Words

Fieldset is love, fieldset is life <3

### Setup

- This dont needs setup, only download it in your favourite server envoirement (we recommend XAMPP) and let it go!!! Tested on PHP 7.0.22 / Doesn't works fine over PHP5 or less.
