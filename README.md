# panchat
The awesome PHP Chat Script, what dont use any MySQL DBs! \(:D)/

-What includes this version?
    -Chat :3
    -Moderation panel for ban IPs, you can ban them and they cannot send messages, or dont use the "Clear chat" function
    -Settings: Auto-Load5 - You can enable it, and the main page will reload every 5 seconds.
    -Delete/Clear chat - You can delete globally the chat
    -You can change your nick in any time!
    -For prevent some strange things, the IP its showed globally by default.
    -By default, all messages are stored in an only file "data.txt", this can be changed modifying "config_auth.php"

-Issues:
    -If do you send a message with this symbol -> ' the script will crash, this have solution, only replace index.php by delete.php in the url bar. If you are banned and cannot use a function, tell a friend. i will fix this later, but isnt easy, so, uhm, probably i dont fix this never...

-To do:
    -Lock the "Delete chat" function to only allowed IPs
    -Ban nicks
    -Ban words
    -Probably the first function may be hard to code it. But i accept the challenge :3 Fieldset is love, fieldset is live <3
